    "desc": "He was born in Hungary and achieved his greatest success by playing the role of 'Death,' or in German 'Der Tod,' in the musical 'Elisabeth.' He became the only actor to perform this role in three languages: Hungarian, German, and Japanese. The success of the musical in Vienna led to the release of a DVD in December 2005, which immortalized their performance at the Theater an der Wien. In 2024, he performed 'The Last Dance' and 'When I Want to Dance' at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, the former residence of Empress Elisabeth, acting as a cultural bridge between Japan and Vienna. He continues to captivate audiences across borders with his voice and charming appeal.",

    "textA": "I consider myself fortunate to be able to work as a singer.",
    "textB": "From my early years, the stage was my dream. Through hard work and dedication, I brought various characters to life, such as 'der Tod,' 'Tony,' 'Jean Valjean,' 'Nick,' and many other wonderful roles. My journey took me from Hungary to Vienna, and then to Japan. When I started my career, I never imagined that I would sing in German, English, and even Japanese. Besides Hungary, Vienna and Tokyo have become my second homes. I am grateful for the opportunities my career has provided, though I have learned that life is full of highs and lows, luck and misfortune. Every moment is special, and I strive to appreciate each one. Every role I have taken on is a testament to the fact that this profession is built on passion and dedication. To achieve success, one needs perseverance and the determination to never give up on their dreams. This is what I believe in."
